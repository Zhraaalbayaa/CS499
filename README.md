## Overview

This repository outlines the steps I took to develop my ePortfolio for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course final project. A professional portfolio is one of the most effective ways to visually communicate our value to potential employers by showcasing unique skills and strengths. The content of this ePortfolio serves as a strong foundation to highlight my expertise across key areas in Computer Science. The included artifacts from various courses within the Computer Science Program reflect my growth in essential domains: software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

All three Artifacts present my skillset in different categories related to the core Software Design and Development fields with a special connection to Algorithms, Databases, and Data Structures. During the entire Computer Program, I followed throughout these years of studying at SNHU, I acquired knowledge in different fields of Computer Science. During this CS499 Computer Science Capstone course I learned how to evolve my ePortfolio and project my accomplishments for Computer Science major. 

## Reflections

[Journal: Marketing with ePortfolio](M3A1JournalMarketingWithePortfolio.pdf "Journal: Marketing with ePortfolio")

This paper explains the importance of ePortfolio for marketing purposes of once achievements and accomplishments in the Software Application Development field. An ePortfolio is an electronic or online document that evolves regularly to record and store the learning artifacts. This document can be used to achieve various competitive advantages such as Skills and completed projects, build professional branding of one profile, present accomplishments and milestones achieved during work or education, serve networking and job searching along with covering continuous education and learning goals.
