## Overview

This repository outlines the steps I took to develop my ePortfolio for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course final project. A professional portfolio is one of the most effective ways to visually communicate our value to potential employers by showcasing unique skills and strengths. The content of this ePortfolio serves as a strong foundation to highlight my expertise across key areas in Computer Science. The included artifacts from various courses within the Computer Science Program reflect my growth in essential domains: software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

All three Artifacts present my skillset in different categories related to the core Software Design and Development fields with a special connection to Algorithms, Databases, and Data Structures. During the entire Computer Program, I followed throughout these years of studying at SNHU, I acquired knowledge in different fields of Computer Science. During this CS499 Computer Science Capstone course I learned how to evolve my ePortfolio and project my accomplishments for Computer Science major. 

## Reflections

[Journal: Marketing with ePortfolio](M3A1JournalMarketingWithePortfolio.pdf "Journal: Marketing with ePortfolio")

This paper explains the importance of ePortfolio for marketing purposes of once achievements and accomplishments in the Software Application Development field. An ePortfolio is an electronic or online document that evolves regularly to record and store the learning artifacts. This document can be used to achieve various competitive advantages such as Skills and completed projects, build professional branding of one profile, present accomplishments and milestones achieved during work or education, serve networking and job searching along with covering continuous education and learning goals.

[Journal: Career Choice](M4A1JournalCareerChoiceAndUpdate.pdf "Journal: Career Choice")

This paper explores my career choices and future plans influenced by the Computer Science program. It reflects on why I've remained committed to my career goals and how my perspective on my career path has evolved. Additionally, I discuss research related to my career choices and how it has shaped my thinking.

This paper will cover the complete reflection of my journey, achievements, and accomplishments evolving ePortfolio and enhancement of three artifacts covering Software Design and Development, Databases, and Algorithms and Data Structures. 

## ePortfolio Artifact Selection

[ePortfolio Artifact Selection](CS499M1ArtifactSelection.pdf "ePortfolio Artifact Selection")

This paper outlines an initial plan detailing how I will fulfill the ePortfolio requirements. While this submission is not the final version, it provides a strong foundation with clear ideas for review. This assignment serves as a starting point for developing a well-thought-out plan to create an ePortfolio that effectively showcases my skills across key areas of computer science.

- Software Design and Engineering.
- Algorithms and Data Structures. 
- Databases. 

## Code Review

Code review has been conducted on the three selected artifacts one for each category of Software Design and Engineering, Algorithm and Data structures, and Databases.   One video for each of these code reviews has been screen-captured with live commentary to explain the step-by-step code review. Code review covers the identification of bugs and errors in the current code base, improvements introduced in these artifacts, and enhancements performed to improve these artifacts. 

## Software Design and Engineering

[Software Design and Engineering](M3A2EnhancementThreeSoftwareDesignAndEngineering.pdf "Software Design and Engineering")

This paper will present the enhancements for artifact one related to the Software Design and Engineering category for the Computer Science Capstone course. The paper entails the details of the artifact chosen for this milestone during the module 2 code review project and is included in the ePortfolio. It also covers the details of the processes and steps taken to create and enhance the artifact. The outcome of this enhancement process will display the outcomes and learnings acquired while completing the enhancements. 

## Algorithms and Data Structures
