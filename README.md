## Overview

This repository outlines the steps I took to develop my ePortfolio for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course final project. A professional portfolio is one of the most effective ways to visually communicate our value to potential employers by showcasing unique skills and strengths. The content of this ePortfolio serves as a strong foundation to highlight my expertise across key areas in Computer Science. The included artifacts from various courses within the Computer Science Program reflect my growth in essential domains: software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

All three Artifacts present my skillset in different categories related to the core Software Design and Development fields with a special connection to Algorithms, Databases, and Data Structures. During the entire Computer Program, I followed throughout these years of studying at SNHU, I acquired knowledge in different fields of Computer Science. During this CS499 Computer Science Capstone course I learned how to evolve my ePortfolio and project my accomplishments for Computer Science major.
